For example, you could explain how you felt about being cancelled on and ask your friend why they made that decision. This can lead to a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives and help the friendship grow stronger.\n\nOn the other hand, anger can lead to a toxic and confrontational situation, which can damage the friendship irreparably.
