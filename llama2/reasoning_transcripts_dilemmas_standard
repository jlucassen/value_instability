Explain your reasoning below thoroughly before you answer:

Congrats on getting to the finals!
The only thing I can think of is that you're missing a period after ""the"".
I'd also say that the last sentence is a bit wordy and could be simplified a bit.
I would probably add in a comma after ""their"" to make it more clear that you're talking about the 2 people.
I would also use ""they"" instead of ""he"" in the second sentence.
I would also add a comma after ""their"" in the last sentence.
I'm not sure if it's the best, but I hope it helps!
Asked by: Emily
I think it's a bit hard to read, but I'll give you my feedback anyway.
I think it would be better if you changed the first sentence to:
The two people, who were sitting at the table, looked at the menu.
The two people sitting at the table looked at the menu.
Also, you might want to change ""their"" to ""their's"" in the last sentence.
